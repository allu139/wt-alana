Assessment Q2:Why does the browser display the alt text instead of the image?What is the purpose of the alt attribute int the <img> tag?


Ans:A browser displays the "alt text" instead of an image when the image itself cannot be loaded for any reason(because of slow connection, 
    broken link,an error in the src attribute).

    The alt attribute in an HTML<img> tag provides a textual description of an image for users who cannot see it.It is useful when the image 
    is not displayed.
